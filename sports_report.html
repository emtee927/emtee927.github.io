      <h1 id="main">Russia's Olympic membership restored by International Olympic Committee</h1>
      <img src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/onesport/cps/800/cpsprodpb/BAB4/production/_100169774_oar_openingceremony_reuters.jpg" ><br/>There were 168 Russians competing as neutral athletes at February's Winter Olympics</img>
      <h2>Russia's Olympic membership has been restored by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) following its suspension from Pyeongchang 2018.</h2>
      <p>Russia was banned from February's Games by the IOC over state-sponsored doping.
<br/><br/>
Despite the ban, 168 Russians competed as neutrals in South Korea, and two of them failed drugs tests.
<br/><br/>
The IOC planned to reinstate Russia after the Games - so long as there were no more failed tests - and it now says all remaining samples were negative.
<br/><br/>
"The suspension of the Russian Olympic Committee is automatically lifted with immediate effect," it added in a statement.
<br/><br/>
The 168 Russians who competed in Pyeongchang as Olympic Athletes from Russia (OAR) had all been required to prove they were clean before the Games.
<br/><br/>
The OAR team was the third largest and won 17 medals, including two golds.
<br/><br/>
The IOC in December banned Russia from competing in Pyeongchang, having concluded that it ran a systemic, state-sponsored doping programme during the Winter Olympics it hosted in Sochi in 2014.
<br/><br/>
Allegations of the country's doping programme had first surfaced in 2015, with whistleblowing doctor Grigory Rodchenkov, director of Russia's anti-doping laboratory during the Sochi Games, a key figure.
<br/><br/>
He alleged Russia ran a systematic programme of doping. He claimed he had created substances to enhance athletes' performances, and that the country's secret service had been helped switch urine samples to avoid detection.
<br/><br/>
The World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada) enlisted the services of Canadian law professor and sports lawyer Dr Richard McLaren to look into the allegations.
<br/><br/>
The McLaren report concluded 1,000 athletes across 30 sports benefited from the doping programme between 2012 and 2015.
<br/><br/>
Wada obtained what it said was a Russian laboratory database which it felt corroborated McLaren's conclusions, while retesting of Russian athletes' samples resulted in a host of retrospective bans and stripping of medals.
<br/><br/>
Russia is also banned from the 2018 Winter Paralympics in March but, again, some athletes will compete as neutrals.

		<h1>Argentina 5-2 Great Britain: Alex Danson scores 50th goal in defeat</h1>
        <img src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/onesport/cps/800/cpsprodpb/863B/production/_100036343_gettyimaged.jpg" ><br/>Alex Danson has played for Britain at three Olympic Games</img>
        <h2>Alex Danson reached the milestone of 50 goals for Great Britain as her side fell to a 5-2 defeat against Argentina.</h2>
        <p>Captain Danson, 32, equalised the hosts' early opener in the third game of the five-match South American Test series to score her 49th GB goal.
<br/><br/>
However, Argentina went into half-time in Rosario with a 2-1 lead and added three second-half goals before Danson got her second late on.
<br/><br/>
The victory means Argentina win the series with two games to spare.
<br/><br/>
The final two matches of the tour are both on 17 February.</p>
		<h1>Tony Garbelotto is sacked by Scottish Basketball and resigns as GB head coach</h1>
        <img src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/onesport/cps/800/cpsprodpb/EA27/production/_100034995_rexfeatures_9218762g-1.jpg"><br/>Tony Garbelotto (right) was head coach of Glasgow Rocks, Scotland and GB men's teams</img>
        <h2>Scottish Basketball has sacked men's national coach Tony Garbelotto six weeks before the start of the Commonwealth Games.</h2>
        <p>The 49-year-old has subsequently resigned as Great Britain's national coach, with GB Basketball citing "personal reasons".
<br/><br/>
Garbelotto has also been coach with Glasgow Rocks in the British Basketball League since last year.
<br/><br/>
Basketballscotland has not given a reason for the departure.
<br/><br/>
"<em>It is with regret that we have had to terminate Tony's contract with the men's national team</em>", chief executive Kevin Pringle said in a website statement.
<br/><br/>
"<em> With the Commonwealth Games now fast-approaching, our focus turns to the recruitment of a new head coach to give them as much time as possible with the squad before April's Games.</em>"
<br/><br/>
However, he stressed that the Englishman would have no further involvement in the men's national team programme.
<br/><br/>
Garbelotto, a former England assistant, arrived in Scotland after a three-year spell coaching Saigon Heat and the Vietnam national team.
<br/><br/>
British Basketball performance director Mark Clark said: <em>"All at British Basketball wish Tony well for the future and thank him for the work he has undertaken with the GB men.</em>"
<br/><br/>
"<em>With the next FIBA World Cup qualifying window fast approaching, the current assistant coach of the GB men's national team, Alberto Lorenzo, will act as head coach for the upcoming FIBA World Cup qualification games in February.</em>"
<br/><br/>
After two games, GB men lie bottom of a qualifying group led by Greece and also containing Israel and Estonia.
<br/><br/>
Garbelotto's Rocks sit third behind Leicester Raiders and Esh Group Eagles Newcstle in this season's BBL Championship.
<br/><br/>
Scotland are due to play in a match against a Rocks select in a warm-up to the British Basketball League final at Emirates Arena, Glasgow, on 4 March.</p>
