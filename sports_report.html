      <h2>Russia's Olympic membership has been restored by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) following its suspension from Pyeongchang 2018.</h2>
      <p>Russia was banned from February's Games by the IOC over state-sponsored doping.
<br/><br/>
Despite the ban, 168 Russians competed as neutrals in South Korea, and two of them failed drugs tests.
<br/><br/>
The IOC planned to reinstate Russia after the Games - so long as there were no more failed tests - and it now says all remaining samples were negative.
<br/><br/>
"The suspension of the Russian Olympic Committee is automatically lifted with immediate effect," it added in a statement.</p>
