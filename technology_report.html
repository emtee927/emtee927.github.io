  <h1><font color="white">Advantages of Facebook</font></h1>
  <h3><font color="white"><em>Communication</em></font></h3>
  <hr>
  <h3><font color="white">Multiple Methods of Communication</font></h3>
  	<p><font color="white"> You can find so many ways to communicate on Facebook, each one tailored to a different type of person's preferences. On your profile, you can post messages, selecting an audience of the public, only your friends and even only yourself. If you want a more private conversation, you can send a direct message to a particular friend and start up a chat in that way. If you want to meet new people with similar interests, you can seek them out in Facebook groups or Facebook pages. Whatever your social comfort level, you can find a place to communicate with others on the social network.</font></p>
  <h3><font color="white">Closing the Distance</font></h3>
  	<p><font color="white">When friends and family members move across the country or to a different one, Facebook can help you stay in touch when you otherwise would not. Time differences can make phone calls difficult to arrange, but Facebook can help you remain in their lives. In addition to communicating directly through posting and messaging, you can play games with them, making them seem closer no matter the distance. If you find that few people around you have similar interests, you can also use Facebook to connect with others around the country and world who do.</p>
  <h3><font color="white">Eliminating Barriers</font></h3>
  	<p>For those with crippling social anxiety, Facebook can help reduce or eliminate the barriers to meeting new people. If, for example, you feel nervous about approaching someone in class about a homework assignment, you may feel more comfortable friending or messaging that person on Facebook. That way, you can think over what you write and can avoid any potential embarrassment present in the first face-to-face meeting. Getting through that initial introduction on Facebook can then help you feel more comfortable the next time you meet that person face-to-face. A number of studies back this up, including "The Influence of Shyness on the Use of Facebook in an Undergraduate Sample," which found that shy people spend more time on Facebook than more socially adept people.</p>
  <h3><font color="white">Ease of Use</font></h3>
  	<p>Facebook's layout encourages personal sharing, commenting and other forms of communication. When you sign on to the site, the homepage fills with stories about others. You can easily comment on the stories and click through to that person's profile -- all without any technical knowledge of the Internet. Facebook is not limited to young people, either. The Pew Research Center found that in 2012, 73 percent of Internet users ages 30 to 49 have a Facebook account and 57 percent of users 50 to 64 have a Facebook account. Even for the group of users over 65, 35 percent have a Facebook account, the largest percentage of any social network for this group of people. Partially because of its ease of use and ubiquity, just about anyone can have and maintain an account, increasing the opportunities for communicating with others on the social network.<p>
  <hr><br/>
  <h3><font color="white"><em>Marketing</em></font></h3>
  <hr>
  <h3><font color="white"> Facebook can be used for sharing information relating to the business.</font></h3>
  <p><font color="white"> It is very easy to create a business page on the social network. People have to enter some useful information regarding their business. History, product details and business purpose will be provided on the page and this will draw Facebook users.</font></p> 
  <h3><font color="white"> Lower Your Marketing Expenses</font></h3>
  	<p><font color="white"> A business can sign up on Facebook for free and for a small startup business this is really useful as they don’t have the money as yet to pay for a website. Marketing is immensely important for every business. According to Danny, the owner of PrimoVPN, the products and services need to be promoted at the right avenue, in order to best promote a business. Facebook is not just free, but it also provides access to millions of target audience that can be converted into potential customers.</font></p>
  <h3><font color="white"> Users can be interactive on Facebook</font></h3>
  	<p><font color="white"> Sharing photos and videos concerning the business becomes very simple on this social media platform. A website is a little professional and owners find it difficult to personalize them. However, a Facebook business page is just like your personal account and no tech expertise is needed for customizing and personalizing it.</font></p>
  <h3><font color="white">This social network allows a business to communicate with existing and prospective clients</font></h3>
  	<p><font color="white">Customers can directly contact the business on their Facebook page, which gives a personal touch as compared to an automated business email.</font></p>
  <h3><font color="white">User traffic to a website can also be increased</font></h3>
  	<p><font color="white">This is done by adding a link to the website on the Facebook page, and also by posting interesting content from website to the Facebook page, so your fans can click the link and read the full post on website. Customers will get the necessary information from the Facebook page and then visit the website to make their purchases etc.</font></p>
  <h3><font color="white">Awareness can also be raised with the help of Facebook likes</font></h3>
  <p><font color="white"> Liking and sharing are excellent tools for a business in achieving multi-level marketing. This means that once the page is liked, people will receive updates made by the business and even their friends will be able to see them and get directed towards the page.</font></p>
  <hr><br/>
  <h3><font color="white"><em>Networking</em></font></h3>
  <hr>
  	<p><font color="white">Facebook is arguably the most powerful social media and social networking site out there. You can use Facebook to connect with your family, friends, work colleagues, and you can even meet new people on Facebook.
<br/><br/>
Most people who know how to use a computer and internet have a profile on Facebook.
<br/><br/>
Moreover, it’s easy to find like-minded people by seeing their interests, and you can easily connect with them using wall updates, private messages, and video chats.</font></p>
